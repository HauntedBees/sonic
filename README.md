# sonic - a relational database visualization

## wut
A web app that displays relationships between entities and data points about those entities - for example, if A is a parent of B and C, and C has some data, you will see C's 
data point on B's page as a related entity, on A's page as a child entity, and so on. Admin users can add entities, link them, add data points, and assign categories to both the 
entities and data points. Users can search for entities, browse entities and data points by name and category, and view graphs showing the relationships between entities.

This web app was developed for [sonic - an unethical consumption database](https://www.hauntedbees.com/sonic.html), a website that shows corporations and brands, their often 
hidden relationships, and questionable behaviors from them (i.e. companies that use child labor, CEOs assaulting employees).

This code can be used for any relational data, but there is some terminology directly tied to the "corporations and their issues" relationship which can easily be changed; the 
logic itself is largely agnostic to the intended use.

## why
I got tired of seeing #hip new products from #trendy new companies only to find out they were subsidiaries of garbage corporations.
