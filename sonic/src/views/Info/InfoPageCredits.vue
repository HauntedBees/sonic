        This site was written by <a href="https://www.hauntedbees.com/" target="_blank">Sean Finch</a>, using the

        roughly meaning that anyone can use and change the site's code, as long as they release their changes under the
        same license. All text is licensed under the

        which basically means the same thing. The source code is available on <a href="https://github.com/HauntedBees/Sonic" target="_blank">GitHub</a>,
        and I'm still trying to figure out a good way to distribute the database itself. If you want a copy before I figure that out, shoot me 
        an email and we can figure something out.
