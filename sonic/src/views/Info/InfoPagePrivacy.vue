        This site doesn't have tracking cookies. This site doesn't use Google Analytics. This site 
        doesn't track what you search for. No information about you or your activity on this site is 
        shared with anyone.

        For people who want slightly more technical information: A self-hosted <a rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://awstats.sourceforge.io/">AWStats</a>
        installation handles some minimal webpage analytics so we can see if we're getting a lot of traffic from a certain website
        or something. No information from this is ever shared or transferred to anyone. When submitting feedback a CAPTCHA is used
        to prevent spam - this creates an HTTP session that stores the correct value of your CAPTCHA on our end. The session does not
        store any other information about you, and is cleared upon the completion of the CAPTCHA. The CAPTCHA information does not
        leave our servers - we do not use any third-party verification systems like Google reCAPTCHA.

        We provide "Search for News" links on individual pages to give users a quick way to look up current events related to the 
        page they are on. Currently these link to a DuckDuckGo news search as we found DuckDuckGo to be the best balance between 
        respecting user privacy and actually having meaningful search results. We are not affiliated with DuckDuckGo. Additionally, we 
        provide links to sources for every issue we track - we have no affiliation with any linked source websites and do not endorse them. 
        All external links are marked with <code>external</code>, <code>nofollow</code>, <code>noopener</code>, and <code>noreferrer</code>
        attributes to ensure that as little information as possible is transmitted to these websites. We do not send any data to these links,
        so if you do not trust them, just don't click 'em. Please note that, while we try to find sources from websites that use HTTPS, some 
        of the linked sources use standard HTTP. Websites transmitted over HTTP can be monitored by your ISP or other third parties. If you can 
        find an HTTPS-enabled source for something that currently has an HTTP website, please let us know.
