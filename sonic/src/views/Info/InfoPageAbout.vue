        "Voting with your wallet" probably isn't an actually meaningful way of inciting change, and picking the lesser 
        of two evils does not address the fact that both options are still evil. But at the same time, you can't change
        what you don't know needs changing! Sure, we all know not to buy from <em>Murder Hut</em>, but do we all know
        that <em>The Definitely Not Murder Shop</em> is actually a <em>Murder Hut</em> subsidiary? How can we make better
        choices if we don't even know the truth about the choices we're making?

        So that's what this site is for. The goal is to let you look up a company or brand and find out if they're actually 
        owned by another company, and give some information about some questionable decisions made by them or any of their 
        related companies, all in one easily shareable place that will hopefully remain more up-to-date than some random
        infographic with no sources circulating social media every few months. However, <strong>this website is not comprehensive
        and may contain out-of-date information. All issues have cited sources, but double check anything that says it is "ongoing"
        or uses the present tense. If you find anything inaccurate, let us know, if you'd be so kind.</strong> It's like Wikipedia:
        more reliable than an anonymous meme, but it should be treated as a starting point or introduction, not a final source.

        This site does not exist to shame people for what companies they support or to make you feel good for not supporting "the
        bad guys." In general, you should not feel guilty for buying things you need from businesses that suck, because companies
        in general tend to suck. While there are certainly companies you <em>shouldn't</em> buy from, this site is not here to make
        that decision for you; the goal is simply to give you the information you need to decide for yourself, or to make you say
        "woah! that tiny local company I've been supporting is actually owned by the biggest megacorporation in the world!? wack!"

        Only buying from "good" businesses is not a substitute for contacting your representatives,
        planned boycotts, protests, donations, direct action, or activism in general. Spending more than a few minutes searching
        here will make it immediately clear that trying to only support ethical businesses is a fruitless endeavour unless you
        want to give up most modern technology and conveniences (and you better be reading this from a library computer or something
        because phone, tablet, and computer manufacturers? hoo boy, they've got some issues).

        But, like, maybe don't buy stuff from Amazon. It's not gonna stop Jeff Bezos from being unfathomably rich,
        but at least when he flees to Mars to escape climate change, you'll be able to spend your final moments 
        dying from air pollution feeling a tiny bit better knowing that you didn't chip in to his Escape Fund.
