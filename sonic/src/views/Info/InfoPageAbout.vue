        <h2>There's no ethical consumption under capitalism.</h2>
        <h4 style="margin-bottom:20px">But maybe some companies are slightly less terrible than others?</h4>
        <p>
        "Voting with your wallet" probably isn't actually a meaningful way of inciting change, and picking the lesser 
        of two evils does not address the fact that both options are still evil. But at the same time, change won't 
        happen if people don't know that things even need changing. Sure, everyone knows not to buy from <em>Murder Hut</em>,
        but do they know that their favorite store <em>The Definitely Not Murder Shop</em> is actually a <em>Murder Hut</em>
        subsidiary? How can people make better choices if they don't even know the truth about the choices they're making?

        So that's what this site is for. The goal is to let you look up a company or brand and find out if they're actually 
        owned by another company, and give some information about some questionable decisions made by them or any of their 
        related companies. Sure, anyone can just do a search for "who owns <em>brand</em>?" but having all that information plus 
        all the receipts on their bad practices in one place makes the learning process a lot easier.

        <strong>This website is not comprehensive and may contain out-of-date information, and as such should not be used
        as a sole source of information. All issues have cited sources, but double check anything that says it is "ongoing" or 
        uses the present tense.</strong> Only buying from "good" businesses is not a substitute for contacting your representatives,
        planned boycotts, protests, donations, direct action, or activism in general. Spending more than a few minutes searching
        here will make it immediately clear that trying to only support ethical businesses is a fruitless endeavour unless you
        want to give up most modern technology and conveniences (and you better be reading this from a library computer or something
        because phone, tablet, and computer manufacturers? hoo boy, they've got some issues).

        This site does not exist to shame people who buy from shitty companies or to enable holier-than-thou attitudes.
        In general, you should not feel guilty for buying things you need from businesses that suck. While there are 
        certainly companies you <em>shouldn't</em> buy from, this site is not here to make that decision for you; the 
        goal is simply to give you the information you need to decide for yourself.

        But, like, maybe don't buy stuff from Amazon. It's not gonna stop Jeff Bezos from being unfathomably rich,
        but at least when he flees to Mars to escape climate change, you'll be able to spend your final moments 
        dying from air pollution feeling a tiny bit better knowing that you didn't chip in to his Escape Fund.
