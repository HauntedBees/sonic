        You can submit feedback through the <router-link to="/info/feedback">Feedback page</router-link>, by clicking the 
        Feedback button at the top of the page, or clicking on the <v-icon color="red darken-2">mdi-alert-box</v-icon>
        icons on individual issues. Another reason this page was made is due to the large number of infographics and memes we've
        seen circulating about how "these <em>X</em> companies own nearly everything!" that often contain extremely out-of-date
        information. We don't want that to happen here. We try to be proactive in updating things and verifying data, but this isn't
        our full time job so some things may be a bit dated or in need of update. We welcome any and all feedback to improve the site 
        and its data!
        </p>
        <p>
        And if you're a lawyer for some company mentioned on this site, we'll gladly remove any information if it's inaccurate or in need
        of revision, but we won't remove verifiable facts even if they make you look bad.

        <h2 style="margin-bottom:20px">Why did you make this?</h2>
        <p>
        Honestly I just kept buying new foods that seemed like they were made by cool and hip new brands that 
        appealed to my #millennial demographic, and then finding out they were actually owned by the same companies
        that own every other brand in the grocery store. Essentially it's just pettiness, curiousity, and maybe 
        something for a family member to discover in a year or two to prompt a very awkward conversation where
        someone asks me "so... I saw your page that tells people when companies use slave labor or are run by 
        sexual predators... does this mean you're some kind of anti-American Commie?"
        </p>
        <h2 style="margin-bottom:20px">What kind of information is this site for?</h2>
        <p>
        The intentions are to help people figure out who actually owns brands/companies/products and to highlight 
        issues with those companies. The general rule of thumb for whether or not a brand will be listed here is how
        easy it is to figure out who owns it -- if your bag of cookies has a big "FunFoods Inc." logo on it, ideally 
        there won't be an entry for the cookies on here, just one for FunFoods. The issues we highlight would be
        considered nonpartisan in a normal world, but because we live in a country where things like the existence of climate
        change and whether or not one should wear a mask during a worldwide pandemic are partisan issues, that may not 
        be how it is actually perceived. If a company is dumping toxic waste in a national park, that's something we'd 
        want to record. If a company's social media account posts some generic platitude in support of a "liberal" social 
        movement, that is not something that is worth recording. Likewise, while we do want to have lots of information, 
        if a company did something bad 20 years ago and hasn't done it again since then, it probably isn't at the top of
        our to-do list.
        </p>
        <p>
        We are also trying to avoid listing actual humans on here unless a certain person happens to own several unrelated
        companies (i.e. Jeff Bezos owns both Amazon and the Washington Post, Elon Musk owns Tesla and SpaceX) - in those cases
        we feel it makes sense to list them so we can list specific things those people might have done that technically don't
        apply to a single one of their companies, instead of having to make separate entries for each company about those things.
        In other cases, we'd rather list the actions of people under the companies they work for. We want to err on the side of
        caution when listing people for several reasons. Practically, people can in theory change, learn, and grow, whereas the average
        big business will likely be as evil as legally possible (or slightly moreso depending on how good their lawyers are) regardless
        of how old they are. Legally, it is safer to say "Company X is a piece of shit that should be destroyed" than it is to say
        "Person Y is a piece of shit who should be destroyed."
        </p>
        <h2 style="margin-bottom:20px">Why don't you share good things companies do, too?</h2>
        <p>
        We're not a PR firm. You can find out good things companies do by looking at the "Philanthropy" sections of
        their websites or watching their advertisements during Pride Month. If a company or celebrity is doing something 
        good, they'll make sure as many people as possible know about it. But if they're doing something bad, they
        aren't exactly going to put up billboards about it. Hence, this website.
        </p>
        <p>
        Besides, the whole point is that there's no way to "shop ethically" in the current system. Any businesses that 
        actually offer goods and services in a completely ethical way would be small local ones that wouldn't even 
        make it to this site anyway; a website dedicated to hyperspecific sustainable local businesses is not a bad idea either,
        but this ain't that.
        </p>
        <h2 style="margin-bottom:20px">Things can't really be THAT bad, can they?</h2>
        <p>
        Did you know there's an entire brand of chocolate whose entire gimmick is just "we don't use slavery or child labor?" 
        That's the baseline. "What if we made chocolate bars and didn't use slaves to get the cocoa?" That was in 2005. Since then,
        the founder said that slavery in the chocolate industry has only gone <em>up</em>. A $50 billion-a-year industry, and nearly
        every company in it still uses literal slavery.

        If the production of a snack food is still so deeply intertwined with such terrible practices, do you really think that
        things are going to fare much better in more profitable or necessary industries?
        </p>
        <h2 style="margin-bottom:20px">This is terrible. What can I do?</h2>
        <p>
        If I knew how to make things better, I'd like to think that I'd be doing those things instead of making this website. Maybe 
        this website <em>is</em> making things better. Maybe you should make a website, too.
        </p>
        <p>
        For perhaps a more genuine answer, I don't think there's much just one person <em>can</em> do to change things. It's not like 
        there's just a few big evil CEOs in charge of things that we can force to step down and then everything will be okay. No country
        is going to elect a president or prime minister that actually fixes things in a long term and meaningful way. The entire 
        system enables and encourages all of the garbage, and one person can't change an entire system. Think about what causes matter 
        the most to you, and look into organizations that are fighting for that cause - especially local ones. Not buying from a 
        bad business won't make them change their ways, but organized and deliberate boycotts have better luck. If you work for a company 
        engaged in some bad practices, reach out to coworkers to try making changes internally (and if doing it through the system doesn't
        work, there's a reason unions and strikes exist). 
        </p>
        <p>
        If you can, donate to groups working to make change. Work with them. Join protests and boycotts. Don't vote for candidates that make 
        things worse. Organize, unionize, and maybe do things that I probably shouldn't mention here (like sending a sternly written letter 
        to a customer service department, obviously~).
        </p>

        Hey, if you think this site saying "this company's CEO is a murderer, and murder is bad" is a partisan issue, then that says more
        about you than it does about me. 
        </p>
        <h2 style="margin-bottom:20px">Do people really ask you questions?</h2>
        <p>
        No, but I figured I'd get a head start so I wouldn't have to bother writing this page later in case someone does.
