        You can submit feedback through the <router-link to="/info/feedback">Feedback page</router-link>, by clicking the 
        Feedback button at the top of the page, or clicking on the <v-icon color="red darken-2">mdi-alert-box</v-icon>
        icons on individual issues. Another reason this site was made is due to the large number of infographics and memes we've
        seen circulating about how "these <em>X</em> companies own nearly everything!" that often contain extremely out-of-date
        information. We don't want that to happen here. We try to be proactive in updating things and verifying data, but this isn't
        our full time job so some things may be a bit dated or in need of update. We welcome any and all feedback to improve the site 
        and its data! Or, even better, if you want to help with keeping this website up-to-date, contact us through that Feedback form
        with something like "hey, I want to help out!"

        <p>
        And if you're a lawyer for some company mentioned on this site, we'll gladly remove any information if it's inaccurate or in need
        of revision, but we won't remove facts even if they make you look bad.

        <h2 style="margin-bottom:20px">Why did you make this?</h2>
        <p>
        Honestly I just kept buying new foods that seemed like they were made by cool and hip new brands that 
        appealed to my #millennial demographic, and then finding out they were actually owned by the same companies
        that own every other brand in the grocery store. Essentially it's just pettiness, curiousity, and maybe 
        something for a family member to discover in a year or two to prompt a very awkward conversation where
        someone asks me "so... I saw your page that tells people when companies use slave labor or are run by 
        sexual predators... does this mean you're some kind of anti-American Commie?"
        </p>
        <h2 style="margin-bottom:20px">What kind of information is this site for?</h2>
        <p>
        The intentions are to help people figure out who actually owns brands/companies/products and to highlight 
        issues with them. We try to approach what an "issue" is in a nonpartisan way. For things like 
        "this company uses slave labor" and "the CEO of this company literally killed someone" we really want to believe
        no one will say "well, I don't see anything wrong with that!" However there will be some issues that may not be
        as unanimously frowned upon. We aren't here to convince you that those things are bad - if you see something and
        think it's not actually a problem for you, cool, just ignore it and move on.
        </p>
        <p>
        We also try to avoid listing <em>people</em> on here unless a certain person happens to own several unrelated
        companies (i.e. Jeff Bezos owns both Amazon and the Washington Post, Elon Musk owns Tesla and SpaceX) - in those cases
        we feel it makes sense to list them. Most people don't own multiple businesses, though, so this is more of an exception to the rule.
        In other cases, we'd rather list the actions of people under the companies they work for. We want to err on the side of
        caution when listing people for several reasons. People can in theory change, learn, and grow. The average big business,
        however, will likely be as evil as legally possible (or slightly worse depending on how good their lawyers are).
        Also, saying "Company X is a bad and should be destroyed" is considered "an opinion," whereas "Person Y is bad and should
        be destroyed" is considered "a threat."
        </p>
        <h2 style="margin-bottom:20px">Why don't you share good things companies do, too?</h2>
        <p>
        We're not a PR firm. You can find out good things companies do by looking at the "Philanthropy" sections of
        their websites or watching their advertisements during Pride Month. If a company or celebrity is doing something 
        good, they'll make sure as many people as possible know about it. But if they're doing something bad, they
        aren't exactly going to put up billboards about it. Hence, this website.
        </p>
        <p>
        Besides, the whole point is that there's no way to "shop ethically" in the current system. Any businesses that 
        actually offer goods and services in a completely ethical way would be small local ones that wouldn't even 
        make it to this site anyway; a website dedicated to hyperspecific sustainable local businesses is not a bad idea either,
        but this ain't that.
        </p>
        <h2 style="margin-bottom:20px">Things can't really be THAT bad, can they?</h2>
        <p>
        Did you know there's an entire brand of chocolate whose entire gimmick is just "we don't use slavery or child labor?" 
        That's the baseline. "What if we made chocolate bars and didn't use slaves to get the cocoa?" That was in 2005. Since then,
        the founder said that slavery in the chocolate industry has only gone <em>up</em>. A $50 billion-a-year industry, and nearly
        every company in it still uses literal slavery.

        If the production of a snack food is still so deeply intertwined with such terrible practices, do you really think that
        things are going to fare much better in more profitable or necessary industries?
        </p>
        <h2 style="margin-bottom:20px">This is terrible. What can I do?</h2>
        <p>
        If I knew how to make things better, I'd like to think that I'd be doing those things instead of making this website. Maybe 
        this website <em>is</em> making things better. Maybe you should make a website, too.
        </p>
        <p>
        For perhaps a more genuine answer, I don't think there's much just one person <em>can</em> do to change things. It's not like 
        there's just a few big evil CEOs in charge of things that we can force to step down and then everything will be okay. No country
        is going to elect a leader that actually fixes things in a long term and meaningful way. The entire 
        system enables and encourages all of the garbage, and one person can't change an entire system. Think about what causes matter 
        the most to you, and look into organizations that are fighting for them - especially local ones. Not buying from a 
        bad business won't make them change their ways, but organized and deliberate boycotts have better luck. If you work for a company 
        engaged in some bad practices, reach out to coworkers to try making changes internally (and if doing it through the system doesn't
        work, there's a reason unions and strikes exist). 
        </p>
        <p>
        If you can, donate to groups working to make change. Work with them. Join protests and boycotts. Don't vote for candidates that make 
        things worse. Organize, unionize, and do what you can to raise awareness for the issues that matter to you.
        </p>

        Hey, if you think "this company's CEO is a murderer, and murder is bad" is a partisan issue, then that says more
        about you than it does about us. 
        </p>
        <h2 style="margin-bottom:20px">Do people really ask you questions?</h2>
        <p>
        No, but we figured we'd get a head start so we wouldn't have to bother writing this page later in case someone does.
